    <h1>Bio page</h1>
<p>My name is Taiwo Ogunbekun, I consider myself to be a smart and intelligent individual, with an outgoing likable personality and an ability to work effectively as part of a team as well as using my own creativity.</p>
<p>Post my presentation the feedback I got from my tutor and peers was outstanding and encouraging. My other strengths include a strong commitment to customer services, and attention. The Btec National Diploma has made me become an organised and hard
working person.  I am highly self-motivated and a good team worker enthusiastic to commence a career in Information Technology or business industry. </p>

       <p>I am able to communicate with numerous amounts of people in any situation I found myself, for example, last year while I was doing a BTEC National Diploma in IT, I participated in a group presentation entitled 'Barriers of effective communication.
